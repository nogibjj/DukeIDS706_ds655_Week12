# This is a default Python repository [![Python CI](https://github.com/DivyaSharma0795/Basic_Python_Repository/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/DivyaSharma0795/Basic_Python_Repository/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Files in this repository include:


## 1. Readme
  The `README.md` file is a markdown file that contains basic information about the repository, what files it contains, and how to consume them


## 2. Requirements
  The `requirements.txt` file has a list of packages to be installed for any required project. Currently, my requirements file contains some basic python packages.


## 3. Codes
  This folder contains all the code files used in this repository - the files named "Test_" will be used for testing and the remaining will define certain functions


## 4. Resources
  -  This folder contains any other files relevant to this project. Currently, I have added -


## 5. CI/CD Automation Files


  ### 5(a). Makefile
  The `Makefile` contains instructions for installing packages (specified in `requirements.txt`), formatting the code (using black formatting), testing the code (running all the sample python code files starting with the term *'Check...'* ), and linting the code using pylint


  ### 5(b). Github Actions
  Github Actions uses the `main.yml` file to call the functions defined in the Makefile based on triggers such as push or pull. Currently, every time a change is pushed onto the repository, it runs the install packages, formatting the code, linting the code, and then testing the code functions


  ### 5(c). Devcontainer
  
  The `.devcontainer` folder mainly contains two files - 
  * `Dockerfile` defines the environment variables - essentially it ensures that all collaborators using the repository are working on the same environment to avoid conflicts and version mismatch issues
  * `devcontainer.json` is a json file that specifies the environment variables including the installed extensions in the virtual environment
